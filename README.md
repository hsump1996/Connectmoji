# Connectmoji


## Part 1 - Connectmoji

For implementation, broken down the game into several functions. These helper functions will be written in a module (a file separate from the file that actually runs your game), which will be used in a later part: src/connectmoji.js


## Part 2 - Connectmoji

Used the module / helper functions you created in part 1 to implement an interactive game that supports the following features:

Scripted moves for both players
User controlled game settings
An interactive game
